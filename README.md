# Home Assistant // Gullburet

This repo contains (the shareable part of) my smart-home configuration. Orchestration is handled by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

### Dashboard services
To display relevant info about life in Oslo and Norway, here are some public APIs we are consuming:
- Entur (Ruter): Public transportation
- Met.no (Yr): Weather
- Tibber: Local electricity ratings, including fees

### Dashboard preview

Here is how the main view of the wall-mounted tablet dashboard looks like.

### Floorplan

The Floorplan-view is built up of different layers of pre-rendered PNGs. Take a look in the `/www/floorplan`-directory of the repo to see the images. Images was created like this:
1. Download and install the free, available software, Sweet Home 3D. Also get the available furniture/interior model packages that are also available for free, that must be downloaded separately.
2. Create the 2D floor plan of the house, and place furniture to cover your desired level of fidelity.
3. In the 3D view, edit heights, depths, widths, material, shinyness, elevation, rotation and so on for furniture, walls, floors as your heart desires. Also add light sources.
4. Find a nice point of view and save it. It will serve as the POV to make all renderings from.
5. Edit environment settings, such as location and elevation of the home. This will impact sunlight in the renderings.
6. Choose a standard date and time for the renders. I use 202X-03-23, since it is in the middle between the darkest and lightest in Norway. I also use 18:30 as time for when it is getting fairly dark.
7. Turn off all light sources (edit light source and set light brightness to 0, or deactivate the light) and create the first render: A completely dark base-image of the home. The less light sources are active on in the images, the faster the renders take to generate.
8. Then go one-light at a time, adjust the light source brightness, and keep all other sources dark. Create renders of all light sources.
9. Use GIMP (free) or Photoshop, and import all images as layers.
10. Add alpha-channel to all images/layers. We will make anything that is not interesting for each image/layer transparent.
11. Crop all images into the same desired size.
12. Use Free-select tool to mark areas of each image/layer that is affected by that image light source, clearing everything else and making the other parts of image transparent.
13. Export a base, dark image and each light source as their own indpendent PNG.
