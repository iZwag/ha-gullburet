blueprint:
  name: Update thermostat control mode on schedule triggers
  description: |
    Takes a schedule input that triggers when certain sleep/comfort modes activate. 
    Off-state of the schedule means Away. 
    Also takes input of which input_select to change control mode of. 
    The delay was added to allow heat sources to turn on properly before updating, in case 
    they were turned on simultaneous with schedule triggers.
